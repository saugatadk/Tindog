# TinDog Project

TindDog is a website that helps dog owners find suitable playmates, companions, or mates for their pets. Similar to the Tinder app for humans, users can create profiles for their dogs, including photos, descriptions, and preferences. 
Just a fun idea, of courseâ€”who knows, maybe it could even work!
